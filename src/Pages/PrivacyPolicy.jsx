			<h2>Personal Information I Collect.</h2>

			<p>
				When you visit the Site, I automatically collect certain information
				about your device, including information about your Ib browser, IP
				address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on your
				device. Additionally, as you browse the Site, I collect information
				about the individual Ib pages that you view, what Ibsites or search
				terms referred you to the Site, and information about how you interact
				with the Site. I refer to this automatically-collected information as
				“Device Information.”
			</p>
			<p>
				I collect Device Information using the following technologies: -
				“Cookies” are data files that are placed on your device or computer and
				often include an anonymous unique identifier. For more information about
				cookies, and how to disable cookies, visit
				http://www.allaboutcookies.org.

			<p>
				- “Log files” track actions occurring on the Site, and collect data
				including your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider,
				referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps. - “Ib beacons,” “tags,” and
				“pixels” are electronic files used to record information about how you
				browse the Site.

				with Google Mail https://www.google.com/intl/en-GB/gmail/about/ to send
				the contents of the form to our emails to contact you.

				Finally, I may also share your Personal Information to comply with
				applicable laws and regulations, to respond to a subpoena, search
				warrant or other lawful request for information I receive, or to
				otherwise protect our rights.

				legitimate business interests listed above. Additionally, please note
				that your information might be transferred outside of Europe, including
				the United States.

				When you contact us through the Site, I will maintain your Contact
				Information for our records unless and until you ask us to delete this
